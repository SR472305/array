/*
1. forEach()
Purpose: The forEach() method executes a provided function once for each element in the array.

Return Value: undefined. It does not return anything. It simply performs the operation for each element in the array.

Usage: Primarily used for side-effects like logging, updating variables, or performing actions on each element,
but it does not create or return a new array.

It cannot be chained (since it doesn't return anything).

syntax:
array.forEach((element, index, array) => {
    // Do something with element
});

*/

let arr = [10, 20, 30];
arr.forEach((element, index) => {
    console.log(`Index: ${index}, Element: ${element}`);
});
// Output: 
// Index: 0, Element: 10
// Index: 1, Element: 20
// Index: 2, Element: 30


/*
2. map()
Purpose: The map() method creates a new array populated with the results of calling a provided function on every 
element in the array.

Return Value: A new array where each element is the result of the function applied to the corresponding element in 
the original array.

Usage: Used when you want to transform elements of an array and get a new array as the result.

It can be chained because it returns a new array.

Syntax:
const newArray = array.map((element, index, array) => {
    // Return the transformed element
});

*/

let arr2 = [1, 2, 3];
let doubled = arr.map(x => x * 2);
console.log(doubled);  // Output: [2, 4, 6]
console.log(arr2);      // Output: [1, 2, 3]  (Original array is unchanged)

// let arr = [10, 20, 30];
// let modified = arr.map((element, index) => {
//     return `Element: ${element}, Index: ${index}`;
// });
// console.log(modified);
// Output: ["Element: 10, Index: 0", "Element: 20, Index: 1", "Element: 30, Index: 2"]




/*
3. filter() :-

1. Purpose:
The filter() method creates a new array with all elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function.

2.Return Value:
A new array containing all elements that pass the test. If no elements pass the test, an empty array is returned.
The original array is not modified.

3. Usage:
Primarily used to filter out elements based on a specific condition or criteria.
The new array contains only the elements that return true from the callback function's test.

4. Can be Chained?:
Yes, since it returns a new array, filter() can be chained with other array methods like map(), reduce(), etc.=

Syntax:
const newArray = array.filter(function(element, index, array) {
    // Return true to keep the element, false to remove it
});

*/

let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

// Filter out even numbers
let evenNumbers = numbers.filter(num => num % 2 === 0);

console.log(evenNumbers);  // Output: [2, 4]


/*
Diffrence between foreach and filter()

1. Purpose :-

forEach():
Used for executing a function on each element in the array.
Primarily for side effects like logging, updating external variables, or performing actions on each element, but it does not return a new array.

filter():
Used for filtering elements in an array based on a condition.
It returns a new array containing only the elements that pass a test specified in the callback function.


2. Return Value :-

forEach():
Returns undefined.
It does not return anything, just performs the given action on each element.

filter():
Returns a new array.
The new array contains the elements that passed the condition specified in the callback function.

3. Modification of Original Array :-

forEach():
Does not modify the original array, unless you explicitly modify it within the function.
It's typically used for side effects rather than transformation.

filter():
Does not modify the original array.
Returns a new array that contains only the elements that meet the specified condition.

4. Chaining :-

forEach():Cannot be chained because it returns undefined.

filter(): Can be chained with other array methods like map(), reduce(), etc., since it returns a new array.

/*
Syntax of reduce()
array.reduce((accumulator, currentValue, index, array) => {
    // Your operation logic
}, initialValue);

Parameters:- 

1. callback function: This function is executed for each element in the array.
2. accumulator: The accumulated value that gets updated on each iteration. Initially, it starts with the initialValue 
provided (or the first element of the array if no initial value is given).
3. currentValue: The current element being processed in the array.
4. index (optional): The index of the current element being processed.
5. array (optional): The array reduce() was called on.
6. initialValue (optional): The initial value of the accumulator. If not provided, reduce() uses the first element
of the array as the initial accumulator value.

*/
let arr3 = [1, 2, 3, 4];

// Sum of all elements with iteration logging
let sum = arr3.reduce((accumulator, currentValue, index) => {
    console.log(`Iteration ${index + 1}:`);
    console.log(`Accumulator: ${accumulator}, Current Value: ${currentValue}`);
    return accumulator + currentValue;  // Add the current value to the accumulator
}, 0);  // Initial accumulator value is 0

console.log('Final Sum:', sum);  // Output: Final Sum: 10
